## JavaScript IMC(BMI) Calculator App

Project inspired by an exercise in "Curso de JavaScript Completo do iniciante ao mestre (2022)
" course by Daniel Tapias Morales.

The idea of this app came up while doing a exercise on JavaScript calculations (one among many). I tried to build something a bit more meaningfull with the exercise proposed.

The app make calculations on Body mass index (BMI)

The BMI is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
It calculated the BMI based also in the age of a person.
